# Google Student Training in Engineering Program

This repo contains Alice's portfolio and STEP projects.

Hi, my name is **Alice**, a google STEP intern in summer 2020. 

Here are two truths and one lie about me:
- My favourite subject in high school was Calculus. 
- I don't like pineapples on pizza.
- I have never been skydiving before. 

Welcome :)
